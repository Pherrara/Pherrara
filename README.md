Hi, I'm a physicist, my interests lie in computational applications to physics and mathematics, physics engines, data analysis, machine learning, neural networks and much more.

My go-to programming languages are Python, C, Rust, Mathematica.

I have knowledges of HTML, CSS and Javascript because I like making things easily accessible for everyone with web implementations.

My favourite IDEs are Jupyter Lab and Visual Studio Code, plus I like versioning just about everything I work on with Git and Github.

VIM > Nano.

Feel free to contact me for anything interesting.
