Hi, I'm a graduated physicist, my interests lie in computational applications to physics and mathematics, physics engines, data analysis, deep learning, AI, neural networks and much more.

My go-to programming languages are Python, C and Mathematica based on what I'm working with and what I need to achieve.

I have knowledges of HTML, CSS and Javascript because I like making things easily accessible for everyone with web implementations.

I would like to learn SQL, C++ and Rust in the future.

My favourite IDEs are Jupyter Lab and Visual Studio Code, plus I love versioning just about everything I work on with Git and Github.

Feel free to contact me for anything interesting.
